      <p class="indented">(1918&ndash;88). The influential American physicist Richard Feynman was corecipient of the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics for work in correcting inaccuracies in earlier quantum-electrodynamics formulations. He introduced simple diagrams—now called Feynman diagrams—to depict complicated mathematical expressions needed to describe systems of interacting particles. His work, which tied together all the varied phenomena at work in light, radio, electricity, and magnetism, altered the way scientists understand the nature of waves and particles. Famed for his wit, he also wrote best-selling books on science.</p>
      <p class="indented">Richard Phillips Feynman was born in New York, New York, on May 11, 1918. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in New Jersey. During World War II he worked on the Manhattan Project, which produced the first atomic bombs. In 1950 Feynman became a professor at the California Institute of Technology, where he remained for the rest of his career. He died on February 15, 1988, in Los Angeles, California.</p>
